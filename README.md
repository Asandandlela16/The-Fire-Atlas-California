# The-Fire-Atlas-California
This project analyzes California wildfire data to uncover patterns, causes, and impacts on communities and the economy. Through clear visualizations, it highlights trends and relationships in wildfire activity, offering insights that support understanding and preparing for future events.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Analyze trends in wildfire frequency and severity over time.
- Identify geographic hotspots for these wildfires.
- Explore the total damage on property.
- Visualize the relationship between fire size, cause, and location.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Property damages
- Fiancial loss per region
- Most common causes of fires 
- Loss distribution
- injuries spread

##  Key Insights
- Human activities caused 38% of these wildifires , lightning being 31% and unknown factors being the other 31% , now this suggests that humans are generally not aware of the fire regulations which is really worrying as Carlifonia boasts a polulation of 39+ Million people;
- Now , looking at the average financial loss by region/location Butte county was the most affected with an average loss of $3290 , while Sonoma County had the least average  financial loss with an average of $1875. When it comes to the total financial loss per region Shanta County was the most affected($38k) followed by Butte County($36K) , which is definitely understandable considering that Butte County only had 1M+ properties damaged while Shanta had 2M+ properties damaged.
- A total of 4000+ injuries were recorded and half of those injuries were caused by human activites , worrying!! Now the injuries spread didn't show any outlier  , suprisingly Mendocino county has the most injuries((687) followed by Shanta County(611) which also makes sense as Mendocino had the most homes/houses destroyed of all the regions also.

# Recommendations

### Raise Awareness & Education
- Because 38% of the wildfires are caused by people, fire safety education for the community should be initiated.
- Preventive education can focus on rural and high-risk counties to decrease neglect cases.

### Strengthen Fire Safety Regulations
- Implement stronger fire-prevention measures like a ban on illegal burning and more-restrictive campfire monitoring.
- Put in place penalties and fines for refusal to help minimize the inevitability of outbreaks.

### Resource Allocation Based on Risk
- UFC2 -S4: Provide additional fire funding, suppression assets, and personnel in those counties that have substantially higher mean losses (e.g., Butte, Shasta).
- Move toward insurance incentives for landowners to take fire-preventing steps.
